# ADD_NN
A simple but an intuitive way to start with Neural Networks by taking the problem of adding 2 numbers 

ADD_NN.py is the file that generates the model for the addition problem. Also the model is saved as sum_model.model

It is being trained with Addition_data_set.xlsx 
It is self made data-set , just usuing generating rand numbers between 1-100 in 2 columns and finding the sum of these in the third column.

test.py is to test the model generated by ADD_NN.py

Note: The result of this model can never be made to 100% accurate answer. With much more data / model optimisation we can reach towards the perfect model.

Fun_Fact : Though this model helps to find the sum of 2 numbers , that does not mean the entire system can be made to run with this model. 
Of course the functions inside tensorflow obviously use the operator
'+' to do the additions inside the neural network . We need the adder circuit (concept in digital electronics) to do all our computations.

This project is just an effort to show that even a simple problem like addition can be understood with Deep Neural networks
